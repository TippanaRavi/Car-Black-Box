# Car-Black-Box
A simulation project using microcontroller PIC16F877A

This simulation project Car Black Box that I have developed during Embedded Systems internship conducted by Emertxe Information Technologies.
This a microcontroller project in which microcontroller PIC16F877A is used.
Black Box implementation in an Automotive System to log critical events. This will help in pro-active vehicle monitoring and maintenance.
The concept of Black Box is mainly heard by us in case of Aero-planes. Upon a catastrophe the Black Box is used to analyze the root cause of the issue. However, the purpose of Black Box can go beyond catastrophe analysis. Also known as an event data recorder (EDR) or Accident data recorder (ADR) the Black Box can be installed in some automobiles to record various events. These events which are electronically sensed can often pro-actively detect any issue in the vehicle (ex: Engine fault) or monitor the fleet (ex: Drive over speeding), thereby doing pro-active maintenance of the Automotive vehicle.
